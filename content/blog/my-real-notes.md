When I took the course on Real Analysis, it made me very nervous. I was having fever dreams from the past when I took undergraduate real analysis and the epsilon-delta definitions just did not make a lot of sense. In retrospect, taking MA504 has been one of the best academic decisions, especially as an engineer. 

It has helped me a lot in how to concretely formulate definitions, and what 'approaching', 'tending', 'limiting', and other weasel words mean in a mathematical sense.

I tried to make notes of the course throughout, and am making entirety of them [available here](/Real_Analysis_Notes.pdf). 
How, I feel, these differ from the textbook (Baby Rudin) and the course notes, is in the sense that they are more concise, I skip over the proofs, and (I think) they are more approachable to an undergraduate level audience.
Please feel free to collaborate as this is an [ongoing repository](https://github.com/omanshuthapliyal/Real-Analysis-Notes) and I will add/subtract from it whenever I get time.

These notes at places are shameful regurgitations of [Prof. Petrosyan's amazing course](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~arshak/S19/MA504/) notes and [Baby Rudin](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Mathematical-Analysis-Rudin/dp/1259064786/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=real+analysis+rudin&qid=1566672781&s=gateway&sr=8-1).
